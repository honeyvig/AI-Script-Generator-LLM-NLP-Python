# AI-Script-Generator-LLM-NLP-Python
üìå Job Overview

I run a YouTube channel and have over 300+ video transcripts that I want to leverage to automate video script generation. I need a developer who can build an AI-powered script generator that will:
‚úÖ Pull relevant information from my existing transcripts
‚úÖ Generate new, structured video scripts in my style
‚úÖ Allow me to add new transcript datasets to train different styles (e.g., mimicking another creator‚Äôs approach)
‚úÖ Let me input a topic or hook and generate a fully formatted script
‚úÖ Avoid words/phrases that might get flagged by social media platforms

The ideal candidate should have experience with LLMs, fine-tuning, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to build a tool that can remix my existing content into fresh scripts with minimal manual effort.

üöÄ If this sounds like something you can build, let‚Äôs talk!
------
To build the AI-powered video script generator for your YouTube channel, we need to integrate several key components: data processing, AI model integration (e.g., GPT-4, fine-tuning), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a user interface (UI) for easy interaction.
High-Level Plan

    Data Processing & Storage:
        Store video transcripts in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or SQL).
        Use a vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB) for fast retrieval of relevant transcript sections.

    Model Training & Integration:
        Fine-tune LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA, Mistral) on the transcripts to mimic your style.
        Implement RAG for dynamic retrieval of script parts from the database based on the input hook/topic.

    Script Generation System:
        Allow for dynamic script generation based on a hook/topic input.
        Ensure that the generated scripts follow a structured format (e.g., hook, body, transitions, CTA).
        Avoid flagged words/phrases (i.e., platform-friendly script).

    UI (Optional):
        Basic UI to input video ideas, select models, and generate scripts.

Python Code Breakdown

Here's an outline of the code structure to achieve these goals:
1. Data Processing & Storage

We will convert your existing transcripts into a structured format (e.g., CSV) and store them in a retrieval-friendly format.

import pandas as pd

# Example: Convert transcript data to a structured format (CSV)
def process_transcripts_to_csv(transcripts):
    df = pd.DataFrame(transcripts)
    df.to_csv('transcripts.csv', index=False)
    print("Transcripts saved as CSV!")

# Example transcript data
transcripts = [
    {"video_id": 1, "transcript": "Welcome to today's video where we discuss AI technology..."},
    {"video_id": 2, "transcript": "In this video, we'll explore the basics of machine learning..."},
]

process_transcripts_to_csv(transcripts)

You can extend this to store the data in a database like SQLite or a cloud-based solution (AWS RDS, Firebase, etc.).
2. RAG and Model Training

You need to retrieve the relevant sections from the transcripts based on the input topic and fine-tune a model like GPT-4 for script generation. We'll use Hugging Face for pre-trained models and fine-tuning.

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset, Dataset

# Load the dataset (you can convert your CSV data to Hugging Face Dataset)
dataset = load_dataset("csv", data_files={"train": "transcripts.csv"}, delimiter=",")

# Initialize the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"  # You can use GPT-4 if available, or a similar model
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Fine-tuning the model on your dataset (you can experiment with this part)
def fine_tune_model(dataset):
    # Here, you can customize the dataset further and fine-tune it
    # For example, prepare the dataset and train the model on it
    model.train()  # Fine-tune model (this part will need adjustments depending on your dataset)
    return model

# Generate a script based on a topic (e.g., a hook or video idea)
def generate_script(topic, model, tokenizer):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(topic, return_tensors='pt')
    output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=500, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return generated_text

# Example usage: Generate a video script based on a topic
topic = "How AI will impact the future of work"
script = generate_script(topic, model, tokenizer)
print("Generated Script: ", script)

This code will fine-tune the model on your transcript data and generate scripts based on an input topic.
3. Script Generation System with RAG

For retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we'll retrieve the relevant parts of the transcript using ChromaDB (or a similar vector database).

import chromadb
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

# Initialize ChromaDB client for text retrieval
client = chromadb.Client()

# Example: Store the transcripts in the vector database
def store_transcripts_in_chroma(transcripts):
    collection = client.create_collection("video_transcripts")
    
    for transcript in transcripts:
        collection.add(documents=[transcript["transcript"]], metadatas=[{"video_id": transcript["video_id"]}])
    
    print("Transcripts added to ChromaDB!")

# Retrieve relevant parts of the transcript based on a query
def retrieve_relevant_parts(query):
    collection = client.get_collection("video_transcripts")
    results = collection.query(query, n_results=3)  # Get top 3 results
    return results

# Example query and retrieval
query = "machine learning basics"
relevant_parts = retrieve_relevant_parts(query)
print("Relevant Transcript Parts:", relevant_parts)

This will allow us to fetch relevant transcript portions for the topic and then pass them to the script generation model.
4. Avoiding Flagged Words (Content Moderation)

To avoid platform-specific flags, you can filter out flagged words using a simple list of prohibited terms or by using a third-party service for content moderation.

prohibited_words = ["prohibited_word1", "prohibited_word2", "prohibited_word3"]

def check_prohibited_words(script):
    for word in prohibited_words:
        if word in script:
            print(f"Warning: Script contains a prohibited word - {word}")
            return True
    return False

# Example usage
script = generate_script("AI and automation", model, tokenizer)
if check_prohibited_words(script):
    print("Script contains flagged content.")
else:
    print("Generated script is safe:", script)

This simple content filtering approach will prevent generating scripts with flagged words/phrases.
5. User Interface (UI) Using Streamlit

Finally, we can build a basic web interface using Streamlit for generating scripts based on the topic.

import streamlit as st

# Streamlit UI for entering a topic and generating a script
def build_ui():
    st.title("YouTube Script Generator")
    
    topic = st.text_input("Enter your video topic or hook:")
    model_choice = st.selectbox("Choose model:", ["Model A (My Style)", "Model B (Other Creator's Style)"])
    
    if st.button("Generate Script"):
        script = generate_script(topic, model, tokenizer)
        if check_prohibited_words(script):
            st.warning("Script contains flagged content.")
        else:
            st.text_area("Generated Script:", script, height=300)

# Run the Streamlit app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_ui()

This Streamlit app lets you enter a topic, select a model, and generate a script while displaying the output directly on the interface.
Deployment and Next Steps

    Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune your model (GPT-4, LLaMA, or Mistral) on the transcript data for better results.
    Storage Setup: Set up a scalable database (Pinecone, ChromaDB) for storing transcript data.
    UI: Build a user interface (Streamlit or a simple web app) for easier interaction.
    Integration: Ensure smooth integration between data processing, model training, and UI components.
    Testing & Scaling: Continuously test and optimize the system for handling large datasets and user requests.

Expected Timeline & Budget Estimate

    Timeline: 2‚Äì3 weeks for the MVP, with an iterative process for improving the script quality and features.
    Budget: This depends on the complexity of fine-tuning and building the full solution. It could range from $5,000 to $15,000, depending on the required customizations and integrations.

This framework provides a robust foundation to create a powerful video script generator that leverages your YouTube content and enhances your production workflow!
